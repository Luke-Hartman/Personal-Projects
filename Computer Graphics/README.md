# Computer Graphics

This is the only class I included any programs from, because it was the only class I have taken which was extremely open ended with only loose requirements and direction given for the assignments.

I have the assignment requirements listed in the readme's in the approriate pages so you can see what I was directed to include and what was my own experimentation.

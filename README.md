# Personal-Projects
Many of these are from when I was learning to program in high school, especially in Common Games. They were not intended toÂ be seen by others, but rather for my development. As a busy college student, I don't have the time to refactor everything, so I won't vouch for the quality of any of it.

The organization is the separate projects are in separate folders. Each folder has a quick README with dependencies, a description and some pictures of the project.

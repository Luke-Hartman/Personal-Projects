# Personal-Projects
Many of these are from when I was learning to program in high school, especially in Common Games. They were not intended toÂ be seen by others, but rather for my development.

The organization is the separate projects are in separate folders. Each folder has a quick README with dependencies, a description screenshots of the project.

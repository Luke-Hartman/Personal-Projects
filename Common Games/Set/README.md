# Set

This is another one of my favorites. It is a tool to assist a user to play the "Set" matching game. It takes a minute to get used to, but I find that using it helps me play much faster.

Use Python 2.7 and Pygame to run

## Instructions:

### End game with ESC

### Lets say we want to make the following card

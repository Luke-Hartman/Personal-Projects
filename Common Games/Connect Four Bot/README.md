# Connect Four Bot

Uses MiniMax algorithm to look a variable number of turns into the future. (If it was smarter it would use at least use alpha-beta pruning and would work in anytime, but I didn't know about these at the time.)

Use Python 2.7, and Pygame to run.
Click directly on the tile you want to play on.

Prints out the expected value (bot is the maximizer) from playing in each of the 7 columns. (-100 is defeat, 100 is victory)

For instance, in the image below, black could have played in either of the indicated places to force a win.

Use Python 2.7 and Pygame to run.

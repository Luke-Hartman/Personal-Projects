# Go

Go game I made during high school.

I also made a fun version with different rules called Tic Tac Go! 
Works great with multiple people, you can cooperatively capture other color's pieces and try to get n in a row!

Go game supports saving and loading progress by pressing Enter.

Click the bottom bar which indicates player turn to skip your turn.

If every player skips the game ends, displaying the scores.

Use Python 2.7 and Pygame to run.

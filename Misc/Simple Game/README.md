# Simple Game

# [Watch Demo](https://youtu.be/YMhGzV0_q-U)

This is a game I made after becoming interested in "Game feel" for games. I implemented some simple things like camera shake, flashing and freezing on impact, and some juicy sounds.

Uses Xbox controller to control. Works for up to four players. (You can also run the game without any Xbox controllers and no player will be spawned.)

End game with "esc"
